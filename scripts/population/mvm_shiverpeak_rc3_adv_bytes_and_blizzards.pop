	//- Giant Backburner Pyro (extended range, decreased spread)
	//- Giant Backburner Pyro (extended range, decreased spread) + Superheal Medic (dps check!)
	//- Shotgun Soldiers, Burst Business Heavies (2:1) (multiclass, burst spawns)
	
	//Subwave 2: Advantage pushing!
	//CHALLENGE: fast bomb pressure.
	//This subwave has a lot of melee bots, pushing the most after the sentry had to be moved.
	//The buster played a major role in that, though Yuugi didn't seem to struggle too harshly as engie?

	//Subwave 3: DPS check! Giants provide consistent damage pressure,

	//- Giant Burst Fire Demo
	//- Giant Burst Fire Demo + Superheal Medics

	//This subwave resembles the prior subwave in approach. Find a way to twist it around better;
	//Consider using a tank or a hitscan giant!
	//Commons provide a need for red to focus fire on them, while not dealing well with sentries.

	//Wave 3: Arctic power! Start: $4450
	//Payout: $2000 + 100 bonus - Max Total: $6550
	
	// Pointers for bots to use
	// - Giant Teleporter Scouts: Used to bring bots forward into the map, or up in players' faces.
	//	 Can be used as opener to securely introduce their mechanic, then spawn in mobbers to make space for other bots,
	//	 or fetchflag bots to introduce a new source of pressure on red
	// - Giant Heavy/Medic combo: Bread and butter of "strong bomb pusher", fit for high cash.
	// - Lowrietta: The iconic wave boss, with decent damage and a cool stickybomb weapon mimic mechanic.
	// - Giant Frostblade Demos: The Cooler Demoknights. I love them too much NOT to use them! And they're effective, too!

	// BOT ROLES
	// Mobber bots that can make space or disrupt players. Quick examples:
	// - Spies (requires other bots on the field for maximum effectiveness)
	// - Burst/Rapid fire explosive bots (through sheer spam)

	// Fetchflag bots that benefit from being brought forward:
	// - Low-range bots that could get sniped from spawn normally. Frostblade Demos, effectively Demoknights But Cooler(tm), are prime candidates.
	// - Lower speed bots that normally take a while to reach the front. Any giant, really!
