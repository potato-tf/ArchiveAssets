// THE ATHAZAR WEAPON PACK (red variant)
// (or for a more fancy and alliterative name, Athazar's Arsenal™)

// A pack of weapons and rebalances specifically made for my next set of NORMAL missions because I feel like it.
// Originally made on a reverse mission that is now scrapped and considered a demo for the various things showcased in that mission.
// If desired, you may ask me (Athazar in the potato.tf Discord) if you want to use these in your mission- chances are, I'll say yes. 
// Just please don't take my stuff without asking and then slap this into some trespasser popfile theft slop like some guy randomly did while also removing all credits/comments/etc from the popfile.

// Disclaimer: None of the weapon models were made by me. They were recompiled by lite after being sent to me in an old community server weapon pack.
// However, I did modify some of the VMT files to fix bugs that spit out consoles in the console. Someone really fucking forgot the CLOSING BRACKET in some of these vmts.

// DISCLAIMER 2: You probably shouldn't combine these with overclocks. I know the GG2 Terrorlict missions combined those two- but as a certain someone said, that was like combining oil and water. Cue the pre-nerf Handheld Howitzer + Crit On Hit Rocket Jumper Incident.

// Actual new normal missions where these will show up featuring brand new ones not originally in TME:

// GG2
// * Butcher - Malpractice [INT]
// * Whitecliff Event - Light Up The Night [EXP] (note: this was a mistake)
// * Terrorlict: Accursed Aggrievocation [ADV]
// * Terrorlict: Echoes of a Warzone [EXP]

// Unnamed New Event, probably
// * Humbridge: Unnamed [INT]
// * Isolation: Unnamed [ADV]

// LIST OF WEAPONS (extremely outdated because of my five hundred updates over the course of GG2. Ignore this entire list aside from the weapon names for now; I'll rewrite the list later.)

// SCOUT:
// Primary: The Payoff - Sets your credit collection radius to half, but killing bots grants you a significantly boosted credit collection range + bonus healing from credits. -1 bullet per shot, 20% more accurate.
// Secondary: Meta-Cola - Cola that gives you soda popper hype and milk on hit. +20% drink effect duration. The milk on hit lasts only 1 second and requires a more agressive playstyle to keep it applied.

// SOLDIER:
// Primary: Spitfire* - Launches mortar projectiles. Bleed on hit, increased blast radius, slightly lowered damage, and no damage fall-off or rampup. Slight damage bonus to tanks to compensate.
// Secondary: Handheld Howitzer - Explosive shotgun with low ammo and an infinite clip along with no falloff. Killing grants 5 seconds of minicrits. Has very slow deploy time and fire rate but can also shoot down projectiles.

// PYRO:
// Primary: The Solar Carbonizer - Alternative Phlog type of weapon that grants Conch and Backup instead of crits, granting more survivability. 20% more MMMPH gain rate, but has 10% less damage (except it also has +15% more tank damage to compensate) and almost zero afterburn (with afterburn upgrades disabled.)
// Secondary: The Calefactor - Shotgun that has less damage and clip size, crits burning players, but has a secondary fire that shoots an arcing fireball projectile.

// DEMOMAN:
// Primary: Sawblade Launcher - The same one from Waters of Wrath & Cascading Steel Swarm/Bog Business (where it's playable). Fires bouncing sawblades, just like in Ultrakill!
// Primary: Primed Directive - Fires bouncy grenades. Grenades have lower basge damage but gain a huge damage bonus when bounced off a surface before hitting a target. -20% blast radius
// Secondary: Polarity Point* - Fires 3 stickybombs in a burst of random spread, with lower fire rate/penalty/clip size and auto detonation. However, alt fire shoots a special magnet projectile that pulls all of your stickies and sawblades towards the magnet. This magnet can stick into enemies too.

// HEAVY:
// Primary: Nail Minigun - Fires nail projectiles with high damage. No move speed penalty while revved, can holster while revved, can move while ducking while revved. Can't use projectile penetration due to the way the projectiles work
// Secondary: Canned Conserva - Lunchbox item. Upon use, 34% of your minigun ammo gets regenerated every 5 seconds for a total of 5 seconds, acting like a free but delayed ammo canteen. When thrown, acts like a medium ammo pack

// ENGINEER:
// Primary: Screwdriver Railgun* - Fires a projectile that drills into enemies for extremely fast bleed damage.
// Secondary: Gamma Gazer - My take on the creators.tf weapon from Digial Directive. Has the rescue ranger pickup effect and fires irradiated lasers that apply a brief healing debuff. Significantly less ammo, a small clip size decrease, lower fire rate. Oh and also it isn't the Wrangler /s
// PDA: Mini PDA - Locks all buildings to level 1 but grants you a mini dispenser and ALL primaries gain a +75% damage bonus. Comes with many bonuses that allow for a very aggressive playstyle.
// Gunslinger Rework: Grants a free 2 disposable sentries, doubled dispenser healing/ammo rate, and +50% sentry damage. Has two new special upgrades: Flame Module and Rocket Module, which changes what your sentries shoot.

// MEDIC:
// Primary: Pill Popper* - Okay hear me out what if we gave Medic a grenade launcher that shoots pills. ACTUAL pills.
// Secondary: The Cauterizer - Healing passively grants your patient a 25% damage bonus vs burning players (doesn't stack on the huo-long, or so I hope) and you an afterburn immunity. Ubercharge grants minicrits, ignite on hit, and high burn damage. Tripled ubercharge rate that can be stacked with the upgrades.
// Melee: The Lethal Injector - My take on the other creators.tf weapon, Hypodermic Injector but renamed. Hitting an enemy afflicts them with a delayed but very strong bleed and applies a strong healing debuff, while also granting you a speed boost and buffed revive rate + medigun range for 1.5 seconds every successful tick of bleed (roughly 6-7 seconds total.)

// SNIPER:
// Primary: 50th Caliber* - Inherent explosive bullets, but explosive headshot upgrade is disabled. +15% damage bonus, pierces resists, +50% damage vs tanks/buildings (it's an anti-materiel rifle), slower move speed, zero movement while scoped, slower charge rate, slower switching/holstering speed.
// Primary: The Astral Assassin - Futuristic bow that fires a volley of arrows which briefly home in on players after a very short delay along with zero movement speed penalty while drawing your arrows.
// Secondary: The Bushman's Brick - Throwable brick that stuns any non-giant enemy for 3 seconds while also marking them for death.

// SPY:	
// Primary: Sharpshooter* - Fires projectile bullets that pierce and ricochet off surfaces. Lowered firing speed/clip size.
// Primary: Tranquilizer Gun - Marks for death + slows down bots, but lower damage/firing speed/clip size.
// Sapper: Timely Demise - Timebomb sapper that explodes 3 seconds after being placed on a robot or building. No longer stuns slows down giants such as super scouts, but upgrading it increases damage/blast radius. Double damage vs giants, too.

// Weapons marked with * have a custom upgrade.

// Special thanks to Lite for helping out with the logic for the following weapons:
// - Spitfire's unique thing with rapid descent
// - The entirety of Polarity Point's logic
// - Pill Popper logic + pill model	
// - Timely Demise kill credit fix + Upgrade compatibility
// - Sharpshooter projectile velocity fix
// - Faithful Mini Dispenser model

// Other Credits:
// OrangeGlazer - Suggesting that we basically turn spy into demoman with the amount of explosive shit he's getting/has planned
// SiF - Only person in potato.tf that actually gives custom weapon feedback, and good/proper/detailed feedback at that
// Ian Hunter - Making a model/texture swap for the Meta-Cola

// MODEL CREDITS //

	// You spend money to attack and you have a special vscript thing where every credit you hold gives you a damage bonus, mimicking a certain item from The Binding of Isaac. (Money is Power)
	// I decided to scrap it because a gun that grants you credits in normal mvm has some fucked up potential and could lead to exploits.
	// This new version is meant to encourage damage scout instead of idle scout, as it forces you to kill to play properly.

	// Dev Notes: Returning weapon, whole new concept to the potato custom weapons space and I'm damn proud of how this turned out. Not to mention lite's help to get this thing working.
	// I should mention that this is also a slightly revamped version- the explosive bullets used are a new addition.
	// Previously it was just higher damage bullets, slower firing speed and just that. Pretty boring sidegrade.
	// I was extremely limited due to a bug where literally any weapon type used for sentry bullets just inexplicably crashed the server.
	// Then that got fixed and here we are. Actual explosive bullets without falloff.

	// Dev Notes: The Flame Module, Rocket Module, Mini PDA, and Gunslinger Reworks are all a combined attempt to make a more interesting playstyle for Engineer should he go Gunslinger.
	// An interesting thing to note is that it's designed to make you more offensive while still being defensive. This is due to the specific addition of "damage bonus bullet vs sentry target".
	// People usually slap on a simple "damage bonus" on all Engi primaries/secondaries which makes him uber offensive. Which might be too powerful at times. Especially given the usual large bonus.
	// By using specifically damage bonus bullet vs sentry target, this forces Engineers to remain defensive because they can't just shred ANYTHING- only whatever's targeted by their mini-sentries.
	// Having a whole +2 mini sentries from the start makes it easier to use the bonus as well. I find it interesting how even if your target is out of the Flame Module's range, you still get the bonus.
