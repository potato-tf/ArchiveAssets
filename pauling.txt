***KNOWN ISSUES***

- "open_charinfo_direct" will crash your game, do not use it

- "cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel 1" will crash your game, do not use it
- .cfg provided to fix the above issue

- Arm and weapon models sometimes overlap or stack on eachother, change class forth and back to fix
- Arms are extremely unstable and unreliable and may ocasionally look like other class arms randomly
- Ammo reserves interact poorly with eachother, since the Derringer uses secondary ammo
